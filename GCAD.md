# Summary
GCAD (short for Geometry CAD) is a text-based CAD format based on geometry notation designed for use with sketch-less geometric constraint solvers.

# Syntax

GCAD uses significant whitespace. Line breaks end statements and spaces separate the names of points.

GCAD defines two dialects: proper (Unicode) and improper (ASCII).

 - Proper GCAD uses the correct symbols from Unicode whenever possible.
 - Improper GCAD uses approximate symbols constructed of ASCII for type-ability.
